I am writing to highly recommend Duane Leem for his exceptional technical assistance in developing the Toastmasters District 57 Speakers Bureau website.

Duane has been an invaluable asset to the project, consistently demonstrating his deep understanding of web development and his dedication to producing high-quality work.

Throughout the development process, Duane has been patient and thoughtful when working with others. I appreciate his willingness to go above and beyond to resolve issues and concerns of the team.

His ability to troubleshoot complex issues has saved the team a significant amount of time in developing and successfully launching the Speakers Bureau website.

Duane is a great listener, always taking the time to understand the needs of the project and offers thoughtful suggestions to improve the website&#39;s functionality and user experience.

In addition to his technical skills, Duane has been a pleasure to work with as we jointly conduct webinars for Toastmasters District 57.

Duane not only provides technical support he is a very accomplished public speaker and presenter

Overall, Duane Leem is an outstanding professional who would be a valuable asset to any organization. His technical skills, combined with his patience and thoughtfulness when working with others, make him an ideal candidate for any project. I highly recommend him without reservation.
