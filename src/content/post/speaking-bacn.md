Hello, and thank you for listening to my speech in this exploration of the intersection of creativity and technology at the Bay Area Consultants Network (Dominican University). I shared with you an exciting realm where Artificial Intelligence isn’t just a tool; it’s a collaborator in the creative process. This journey through AI-generated imagery has been nothing short of remarkable, and I’m thrilled to have had the opportunity to present my findings and demonstrations on this topic.
