To Whom It May Concern. 

There are not enough Great words to describe Duane Leem and his Extraordinary Talented work.

I hired Duane many years ago to work with me in My Concord, CA.office to build my Stagedhomes official website in the early 2,000’s years. And Build it he did. His care, openness, talent and knowledge were outstanding and grew to be Totally AMAZING. 

His belief in Education proved to be phenomenal and He has never stopped his Education to this very day. 

My Stagedhomes site grew to be the leader in Home Staging because of Duane. As I am the inventor of Home Staging and the Staging Industry this was and is now very important to me with what Duane has done and still does because of his Vast knowledge in the Tech industry.

I literally know that there isn’t anything that Duane cannot build, grow, create and do for his clients which I am one of and those who employ Duane.

It is my honor to write a recommendation for Duane Leem and my honor to work with him at anytime for any project which I employ him for today also.

It is a joy to work together with you always Duane as You are a True Leader in the Tech Industry always!

Duane you are The Best of The Best and I am forever eternally Grateful for You!

The Inventor of Home Staging and the Staging Industry
