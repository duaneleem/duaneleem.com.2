I highly recommend Duane Leem for his exceptional tech skills and leadership abilities. As the past Toastmasters Division B Director, I have had the pleasure of working closely with Duane in his role as one of my Area Directors for 2021-2022 .

During that time Duane was an invaluable asset, a great team player, extremely reliable and proved to be an important member of my team. He consistently demonstrated exceptional leadership skills, strategic thinking, and a deep commitment to delivering results. He is a techie so his understanding of computers and the technical aspects of our roles was a great help during contest season and our District Spring Conference because everything was done online. He was a great representative for his clubs, motivating and working very well with all the leadership teams. Duane also helped with the organization of the Division B Realignment Townhall. 

As the Co-Chair of the Toastmasters District 57 Speakers Bureau, I had the privilege of recruiting Duane to join our committee. Duane's contributions were invaluable, particularly in the development of our website. His passion for our mission and his dedication to ensuring the successful completion of our projects was evident through his willingness to go above and beyond. He is a forward-thinking professional with a great attitude and always willing to help others. 

Duane would be a valuable addition to any organization, and I strongly recommend him for any position that requires exceptional tech skills, strong leadership abilities, and a deep commitment to excellence.
